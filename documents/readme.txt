PayFlow: Micropayments for Bandwidth Reservations in Software Defined Networks
David Chen, Zhiyue Zhang, Ambrish Krishnan, Bhaskar Krishnamachari

We present PayFlow: a fine-granularity QoS micropayment system that allows end devices in a software-defined network to make and 
pre-pay for guaranteed bandwidth reservations for their flows within the network for an arbitrary period of time. PayFlow combines 
payments using digital currency and storage of transaction records in a distributed ledger with queue-based QoS management using 
software-defined networks. While the PayFlow architecture is agnostic to the choice of digital currency, ledger technology and SDN 
platform used, we present a proof of concept implementation of PayFlow using OpenFlow and the IOTA cryptocurrency and distributed 
ledger, that we evaluate using the Mininet emulator.
